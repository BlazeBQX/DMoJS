            <p>Shōriki Matsutarō (1885–1969) started practicing judo in middle school, reaching 3rd dan before graduating from Japan’s preeminent university, Tokyo University, in 1911.</p>
            <br>
            <p>By 1926, Shōriki had reached 5th dan, but after 1926 he had very little time to train. He shifted his attention to media and launched multiple business ventures. He founded the newspaper agency Yomiuri shinbun, the Japanese Professional Baseball League and the league’s first team the Yomiuri Giants, and Japan’s first commercial television station (Nippon Television Network).  His life was not without controversy, however. Shōriki was accused by the Korean government of inciting the massacre of zainichi after the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake. He was also classified as a class A war criminal, after World War II, and was imprisoned for two years. He is also notable for his success as a politician, serving as the first chairman of Japan’s Atomic Energy Commission, and more recently it was discovered that he worked as a CIA agent.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In terms of judo, however, Shōriki is noted for being the first “nonprofessional” to be awarded 10th dan. He was awarded 10th dan as a result of his massive financial contributions to the promotion of Kōdōkan as well as the construction of the new Kōdōkan headquarters in 1958.</p>

            <p>The Dutch Anton Geesink (1934–2010) started training in judo when he was fourteen, competing in tournaments by seventeen.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Geesink’s first big victory came in 1961 when he beat Sone Koji (1928–1981), the defending champion, at the World Championships in Paris. This victory was pivotal in judo history, as Geesink became the first non-Japanese world champion. This victory is also what caused the elimination of the “open-weight” event at the World Championships. Geesink’s most influential victory came three years later at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, the first to include judo. He pinned the much smaller Kaminaga Akio (1936–1993) for an ippon. This victory was important because it shattered the myth of Japan’s invincibility in judo and opened the gates for other non-Japanese judoka. The 1964 Olympics were also televised live, which contributed to the international growth of judo.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of Geesink’s other notable accomplishments in judo include having his rank of 10th dan recognized by the International Judo Federation and becoming a member of the International Judo Federation Hall of Fame. He also became a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1987 and suggested the use of white and blue judogi, which are the suits worn by judoka. Geesink’s time in the committee was marred by his involvement in a vote-buying scandal in 1999 involving thirteen IOC members, but he was allowed to remain in the committee. Geesink also had his own judo club in his hometown, which he taught in.</p>

            <p>The 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics were one of the single most important events in the history of judo.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The 1964 games were the first to be held in Asia, the first to be televised live, and the first to include judo. The hosts claimed gold in the first three events 68kg, 80kg, and 80+kg, but the open category had a surprise in store. The Japanese competitor, Kaminaga Akio, fell to the much larger Dutchman, Anton Geesink. This match was incredibly important for the growth of judo, proving that non-Japanese judoka could compete at the highest level. It led to a surge in the international growth of judo, particularly in Europe.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The 1964 games were a pivotal moment in judo history, leading to it being the first Japanese sport to gain international success and it remains one of the most popular Japanese sports today.</p>

            <p>Kanō Jigorō (1860–1938) created judo in 1882 and founded a dojo in the same year which would later be named <span title="Kōdōkan is the first school of judo, established by Kanō Jigorō in 1882."><mark>Kōdōkan</mark></span>. He created judo by combining techniques from <span title="A Japanese system of unarmed combat and physical training."><mark>jujutsu</mark></span> schools that he was familiar with. He took the striking and strangling techniques from <span title="A jujutsu school comprised of striking, throwing, immobilization, and choking techniques.

Kōdōkan’s founder, Kanō Jigorō, utilized the throwing techniques from this school to create judo."><mark>Kito-ryū</mark></span> school.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Kanō is also largely responsible for judo’s accessibility which led to its explosive international growth. Judo was designed to allow a smaller and weaker person to beat a larger, less-skilled person. Women were also accepted at <span title="Kōdōkan is the first school of judo, established by Kanō Jigorō in 1882."><mark>Kōdōkan</mark></span> and spectators were invited to watch tournaments. Another important factor was Kanō’s revision of the ranking system. He created a system of ten ranks (<span title="Dan are ranks that signify the skill of a judoka, a person who practices judo. There are ten ranks, one being the lowest and ten the highest."><mark>dan</mark></span>) rather than the system of three that was standard in other forms of <span title="A Japanese system of unarmed combat and physical training."><mark>jujutsu</mark></span>. This change rewarded students more often, encouraging them to continue practicing judo. Kanō was a prominent educator who taught at various educational institutions, founded his own private institution, and also held various positions at the Ministry of Education. Due to this, Kanō was able to spread judo domestically through universities, the Naval Academy, and the Police Bureau. This domestic success encouraged Kanō to introduce judo abroad. Judo found quick success in Europe in the first half of the twentieth century, particularly in Britain, France, and Germany. Judo’s success both domestically and internationally led to its inclusion as an Olympic sport beginning with the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.</p>

            <p>Tomita Tsunejirō (1865–1937) was the first person to become a live-in student at <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He was only five years younger than Kanō Jigorō and was the student who Kanō spent the most time directly training. Tomita contributed greatly to the early development of <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> judo by testing <mark>jujutsu</mark> techniques with Kanō.
              <br> <br> Tomita was considered the least skilled and physically gifted of the <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> “<mark2>Kings</mark2>,” but even he had important victories that established <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> judo as a legitimate form of <mark>jujutsu</mark>. Namely, his victory over the giant Nakamura Hansuke (1845–1897), known as the “Demon Slayer of the <mark>Ryōi shintō-ryū</mark>.” He also had his fair share of notable defeats. His worst defeats were at a demonstration of judo to West Point cadets in 1905 and in front of President Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919) in 1908. Tomita returned to Japan in 1910, where he continued teaching judo as well as American physical education such as boxing and weight lifting. He taught these subjects until his death in 1937, after which he was promoted to 7th <mark>dan</mark>.
              <br> <br> Tomita’s son, Tsuneo, became a famous novelist and managed to reach 5th <mark>dan</mark>. His most famous work was Sugata Sanshirō, a novel about Saigō Shirō’s life. In 1943, a film adaptation of the book was the directorial debut of the famous Japanese director Kurosawa Akira. Since then, multiple films, TV series, and manga adaptations have been released, turning Saigō into a bigger legend than Kanō.</p>

            <p>The details of Saigō Shirō’s (1866–1922) early life are cloudy. He lost his father when he was six, and it is rumored that he was a problem child who constantly got in street fights, a habit that continued into his adult life. Saigō wanted to enter the military academy and become a great general. So, in 1882, he left for Tokyo with his friend. Once he arrived in Tokyo, however, he soon realized it would be impossible to enter the military academy.
              <br> <br> After arriving in Tokyo, Saigō originally trained at the <mark>Tenjin Shin'yō</mark> dojo of Keitaro Inoue. Supposedly, Kanō Jigorō saw him training and was impressed with his talent, so he invited him to train at the <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> dojo. Saigō became the second live-in student at the dojo. Saigō had some martial arts training prior to entering <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>, but it is unclear who in Aizu-Wakamatsu taught him. Even Kanō Jigorō himself stated from the beginning that Saigō was hard to handle. Saigō reached 5th <mark>dan</mark> at age 21, skipping 4th <mark>dan</mark> in the process. He is said to have been so skilled that after seeing a technique only once he could not only remember it, but improve upon it.
              <br> <br> Ultimately, Saigō departed from <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> sometime after 1886. <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> claimed that he was expelled, but he claims that he left voluntarily to join the <mark>tairiku ronin</mark>.</p>

            <p>Fukuda Keiko was the longest surviving student of Kanō Jigorō until her death in 2013. 
              <br> <br> She achieved 5th <mark>dan</mark> in 1953, which was the limit for women at the time. Following a successful campaign to abolish the limit in 1972, Fukuda Keiko and Noritomi Masako (1913–1982) were awarded 6th <mark>dan</mark>. In 1994, Fukuda was the first woman to receive the ranking of 8th <mark>dan</mark>. After being promoted to 9th <mark>dan</mark> by the United States Judo Federation (USJF) in 2001, another petition was started to grant her the same rank from <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. Fukuda waited five years for the petition to be accepted. In 2011, Fukuda received promotion to 10th <mark>dan</mark> from the USJF, becoming the first women to achieve a rank of 10th <mark>dan</mark>. 
              <br> <br> She was a heavy advocate of <mark>kata</mark>. She was particularly fond of <mark>ju-no-kata</mark>, which is a stretching exercise that requires no mat or particular uniform and it does not involve throwing so it can be practiced by anyone. She wrote a book on <mark>ju-no-kata</mark> in 2004 titled <mark>Ju-No-Kata: A Kodokan textbook, revised and expanded from Born for the Mat</mark>. 
              <br> <br> Some of her other notable achievements include the creation of the Soko Joshi Judo Club, a women’s judo club in San Francisco that holds classes and kata tournaments. She also established the annual Joshi Judo Camp, a training camp for women from around the world. She was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the Japanese government, which recognizes long-term public service. Fukuda’s legacy lives on in the annual Fukuda Invitational Kata Championships and the Keiko Fukuda Judo Scholarship.</p>

        <br> <br> Kanō is also largely responsible for judo’s accessibility which led to its explosive international growth. Judo was designed to allow a smaller and weaker person to beat a larger, less-skilled person. Women were also accepted at <span title="Kōdōkan is the first school of judo, established by Kanō Jigorō in 1882."><mark>Kōdōkan</mark></span> and spectators were invited to watch tournaments. Another important factor was Kanō’s revision of the ranking system. He created a system of ten ranks (<span title="Dan are ranks that signify the skill of a judoka, a person who practices judo. There are ten ranks, one being the lowest and ten the highest."><mark>dan</mark></span>) rather than the system of three that was standard in other forms of <span title="A Japanese system of unarmed combat and physical training."><mark>jujutsu</mark></span>. This change rewarded students more often, encouraging them to continue practicing judo. Kanō was a prominent educator who taught at various educational institutions, founded his own private institution, and also held various positions at the Ministry of Education. Due to this, Kanō was able to spread judo domestically through universities, the Naval Academy, and the Police Bureau. This domestic success encouraged Kanō to introduce judo abroad. Judo found quick success in Europe in the first half of the twentieth century, particularly in Britain, France, and Germany. Judo’s success both domestically and internationally led to its inclusion as an Olympic sport beginning with the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.

      <p ALIGN= "left"> Tomita Tsunejirō (1865–1937) was the first person to become a live-in student at <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He was only five years younger than Kanō Jigorō and was the student who Kanō spent the most time directly training. Tomita contributed greatly to the early development of <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> judo by testing <mark>jujutsu</mark> techniques with Kanō.
        <br> <br> Tomita was considered the least skilled and physically gifted of the <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> “<mark2>Kings</mark2>,” but even he had important victories that established <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> judo as a legitimate form of <mark>jujutsu</mark>. Namely, his victory over the giant Nakamura Hansuke (1845–1897), known as the “Demon Slayer of the <mark>Ryōi shintō-ryū</mark>.” He also had his fair share of notable defeats. His worst defeats were at a demonstration of judo to West Point cadets in 1905 and in front of President Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919) in 1908. Tomita returned to Japan in 1910, where he continued teaching judo as well as American physical education such as boxing and weight lifting. He taught these subjects until his death in 1937, after which he was promoted to 7th <mark>dan</mark>.
        <br> <br> Tomita’s son, Tsuneo, became a famous novelist and managed to reach 5th <mark>dan</mark>. His most famous work was Sugata Sanshirō, a novel about Saigō Shirō’s life. In 1943, a film adaptation of the book was the directorial debut of the famous Japanese director Kurosawa Akira. Since then, multiple films, TV series, and manga adaptations have been released, turning Saigō into a bigger legend than Kanō.

      <p>The details of Saigō Shirō’s (1866–1922) early life are cloudy. He lost his father when he was six, and it is rumored that he was a problem child who constantly got in street fights, a habit that continued into his adult life. Saigō wanted to enter the military academy and become a great general. So, in 1882, he left for Tokyo with his friend. Once he arrived in Tokyo, however, he soon realized it would be impossible to enter the military academy.
        <br> <br> After arriving in Tokyo, Saigō originally trained at the <mark>Tenjin Shin'yō</mark> dojo of Keitaro Inoue. Supposedly, Kanō Jigorō saw him training and was impressed with his talent, so he invited him to train at the <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> dojo. Saigō became the second live-in student at the dojo. Saigō had some martial arts training prior to entering <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>, but it is unclear who in Aizu-Wakamatsu taught him. Even Kanō Jigorō himself stated from the beginning that Saigō was hard to handle. Saigō reached 5th <mark>dan</mark> at age 21, skipping 4th <mark>dan</mark> in the process. He is said to have been so skilled that after seeing a technique only once he could not only remember it, but improve upon it.
        <br> <br> Ultimately, Saigō departed from <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> sometime after 1886. <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> claimed that he was expelled, but he claims that he left voluntarily to join the <mark>tairiku ronin</mark>.

        <br> <br> By 1926, Matsutarō had reached 5th <mark>dan</mark>, but after 1926 he had very little time to train. He shifted his attention to media and launched multiple business ventures. He founded the newspaper agency <i>Yomiuri shinbun</i>, the Japanese Professional Baseball League and the league’s first team the Yomiuri Giants, and Japan’s first commercial television station (Nippon Television Network).  His life was not without controversy, however. Matsutarō was accused by the Korean government of inciting the massacre of <mark>zainichi</mark> after the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake. He was also classified as a class A war criminal, after World War II, and was imprisoned for two years. He is also notable for his success as a politician, serving as the first chairman of Japan’s Atomic Energy Commission, and more recently it was discovered that he worked as a CIA agent. 
        <br> <br> In terms of judo, however, Matsutarō is noted for being the first “nonprofessional” to be awarded 10th <mark>dan</mark>. He was awarded 10th <mark>dan</mark> as a result of his massive financial contributions to the promotion of <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> as well as the construction of the new <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> headquarters in 1958.

      <p> Fukuda Keiko was the longest surviving student of Kanō Jigorō until her death in 2013. 
        <br> <br> She achieved 5th <mark>dan</mark> in 1953, which was the limit for women at the time. Following a successful campaign to abolish the limit in 1972, Fukuda Keiko and Noritomi Masako (1913–1982) were awarded 6th <mark>dan</mark>. In 1994, Fukuda was the first woman to receive the ranking of 8th <mark>dan</mark>. After being promoted to 9th <mark>dan</mark> by the United States Judo Federation (USJF) in 2001, another petition was started to grant her the same rank from <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. Fukuda waited five years for the petition to be accepted. In 2011, Fukuda received promotion to 10th <mark>dan</mark> from the USJF, becoming the first women to achieve a rank of 10th <mark>dan</mark>. 
        <br> <br> She was a heavy advocate of <mark>kata</mark>. She was particularly fond of <mark>ju-no-kata</mark>, which is a stretching exercise that requires no mat or particular uniform and it does not involve throwing so it can be practiced by anyone. She wrote a book on <mark>ju-no-kata</mark> in 2004 titled <mark>Ju-No-Kata: A Kodokan textbook, revised and expanded from Born for the Mat</mark>. 
        <br> <br> Some of her other notable achievements include the creation of the Soko Joshi Judo Club, a women’s judo club in San Francisco that holds classes and kata tournaments. She also established the annual Joshi Judo Camp, a training camp for women from around the world. She was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the Japanese government, which recognizes long-term public service. Fukuda’s legacy lives on in the annual Fukuda Invitational Kata Championships and the Keiko Fukuda Judo Scholarship.
