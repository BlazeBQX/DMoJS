            <p>The Mekyūkai (The Golden Players Club) was founded by Kaneda Masaichi (1933-2019) in 1978. Contrary to the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame, induction is based almost entirely off of stats. A player needs to get either 2,000 hits, 250 wins or 250 saves during their time with the NPB to be inducted into the hall. If a player does not reach these stats but is deemed to have equivalent achievements in the NPB, they can be voted in by a special committee.

            <p>Horace Wilson, a British English teacher in Japan, is credited with introducing baseball to Japan in 1873 by bringing the rules and equipment to his students at Kaisei School. Despite a standardized rulebook not being established in Japan until 1916, with Spalding’s Baseball Guides setting a general set of rules previous to that, Japanese students popularized the western game and agreed on which set of rules they would use before each game was played.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The first Japanese high school, the First Higher School of Tokyo (mononymously referred to as Ichikō), is famous for having the first organized baseball team in Japan with their students. Japanese baseball culture was born at Ichikō, where the “bloody urine” practice was coined from the bloody urine the players had after grueling practice everyday. Many of the students were not allowed to express their pain, only that they felt “itchy” (kayui), and it was easy to tell who the pitchers were based on their crooked pitching arm from overthrowing curveballs. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Schools that initially adopted baseball in Japan were typically wealthy middle and high schools, and the culture surrounding baseball was one of elitism and westernization. It wasn’t until Hiroshi Hiraoka (1856–1934) brought baseball equipment to Japan as souvenirs  from the U.S. in 1876 that baseball became a more accessible sport. Hiroshi created the first official baseball team in Japan, the *Shimbashi Athletic Club, and built the first baseball diamond with spectator stands in Japan. While his team eventually died out, competitive baseball teams not associated with schools were created in the aftermath of the Shimbashi Athletic Club.

            <p>The Kōshien annual baseball tournament is the quintessential baseball event in Japan. Known mononymously by the name of the stadium its takes place in, the Kōshien tournament began as a high school baseball competition in 1915, which is now considered the beginning of competitive baseball in Japan. Founded by a rivalry between Osaka newspaper agencies Asahi shinbun and Mainichi shinbun, Kōshien had the greatest participation of any sporting event in the world before WW2 with an average of 5,000 players. The popularity of the event spurred the need for a single-purpose baseball stadium in Japan. Kōshien stadium had been built and was the highest capacity baseball stadium in Japan until 1988. The Kōshien tournament featured players from all corners of Japan and all classes, diverging from elitist schools like Ichiko. Even today, the Kōshien tournament is widely regarded as the ultimate show of guts and courage for middle and high school baseball players, and it retains its popularity as an icon of Japanese baseball.

            <p>Tomita Tsunejirō (1865–1937) was the first person to become a live-in student at <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He was only five years younger than Kanō Jigorō and was the student who Kanō spent the most time directly training. Tomita contributed greatly to the early development of <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> judo by testing <mark>jujutsu</mark> techniques with Kanō.
              <br> <br> Tomita was considered the least skilled and physically gifted of the <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> “<mark2>Kings</mark2>,” but even he had important victories that established <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> judo as a legitimate form of <mark>jujutsu</mark>. Namely, his victory over the giant Nakamura Hansuke (1845–1897), known as the “Demon Slayer of the <mark>Ryōi shintō-ryū</mark>.” He also had his fair share of notable defeats. His worst defeats were at a demonstration of judo to West Point cadets in 1905 and in front of President Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919) in 1908. Tomita returned to Japan in 1910, where he continued teaching judo as well as American physical education such as boxing and weight lifting. He taught these subjects until his death in 1937, after which he was promoted to 7th <mark>dan</mark>.
              <br> <br> Tomita’s son, Tsuneo, became a famous novelist and managed to reach 5th <mark>dan</mark>. His most famous work was Sugata Sanshirō, a novel about Saigō Shirō’s life. In 1943, a film adaptation of the book was the directorial debut of the famous Japanese director Kurosawa Akira. Since then, multiple films, TV series, and manga adaptations have been released, turning Saigō into a bigger legend than Kanō.</p>

            <p>The details of Saigō Shirō’s (1866–1922) early life are cloudy. He lost his father when he was six, and it is rumored that he was a problem child who constantly got in street fights, a habit that continued into his adult life. Saigō wanted to enter the military academy and become a great general. So, in 1882, he left for Tokyo with his friend. Once he arrived in Tokyo, however, he soon realized it would be impossible to enter the military academy.
              <br> <br> After arriving in Tokyo, Saigō originally trained at the <mark>Tenjin Shin'yō</mark> dojo of Keitaro Inoue. Supposedly, Kanō Jigorō saw him training and was impressed with his talent, so he invited him to train at the <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> dojo. Saigō became the second live-in student at the dojo. Saigō had some martial arts training prior to entering <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>, but it is unclear who in Aizu-Wakamatsu taught him. Even Kanō Jigorō himself stated from the beginning that Saigō was hard to handle. Saigō reached 5th <mark>dan</mark> at age 21, skipping 4th <mark>dan</mark> in the process. He is said to have been so skilled that after seeing a technique only once he could not only remember it, but improve upon it.
              <br> <br> Ultimately, Saigō departed from <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> sometime after 1886. <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> claimed that he was expelled, but he claims that he left voluntarily to join the <mark>tairiku ronin</mark>.</p>

            <p>Fukuda Keiko was the longest surviving student of Kanō Jigorō until her death in 2013. 
              <br> <br> She achieved 5th <mark>dan</mark> in 1953, which was the limit for women at the time. Following a successful campaign to abolish the limit in 1972, Fukuda Keiko and Noritomi Masako (1913–1982) were awarded 6th <mark>dan</mark>. In 1994, Fukuda was the first woman to receive the ranking of 8th <mark>dan</mark>. After being promoted to 9th <mark>dan</mark> by the United States Judo Federation (USJF) in 2001, another petition was started to grant her the same rank from <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. Fukuda waited five years for the petition to be accepted. In 2011, Fukuda received promotion to 10th <mark>dan</mark> from the USJF, becoming the first women to achieve a rank of 10th <mark>dan</mark>. 
              <br> <br> She was a heavy advocate of <mark>kata</mark>. She was particularly fond of <mark>ju-no-kata</mark>, which is a stretching exercise that requires no mat or particular uniform and it does not involve throwing so it can be practiced by anyone. She wrote a book on <mark>ju-no-kata</mark> in 2004 titled <mark>Ju-No-Kata: A Kodokan textbook, revised and expanded from Born for the Mat</mark>. 
              <br> <br> Some of her other notable achievements include the creation of the Soko Joshi Judo Club, a women’s judo club in San Francisco that holds classes and kata tournaments. She also established the annual Joshi Judo Camp, a training camp for women from around the world. She was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the Japanese government, which recognizes long-term public service. Fukuda’s legacy lives on in the annual Fukuda Invitational Kata Championships and the Keiko Fukuda Judo Scholarship.</p>

            <p>Yokoyama Sakujirō is famous for being the most physically powerful of the <mark2>Four Kings</mark2> of <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He is rumored to have sliced a burglar in half with a sword at only thirteen years old. 
              <br> <br> Yokoyama trained at the <mark>Tenjin Shin'yō ryū</mark>, but switched to <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> in 1886 after losing to the much smaller Saigō Shirō in a challenge match. Yokoyama and Saigō had vastly different styles; Yokoyama was described as a wild boar while Saigō was likened to an expertly trained thoroughbred. Prior to entering <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>, he was already skilled in the techniques of <mark>Tenjin Shin'yō ryū</mark> <mark>jujutsu</mark>, so he was able to reach 2nd <mark>dan</mark> in just six months at <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. Due to his fighting style and incredible raw strength he earned the nickname “Demon.” His nickname is unrelated to “Demon-Slayer” Nakamura Hansuke, but the two did compete in a match that lasted 55 minutes, ending in a tie. Yokoyama, like Saigō, got in many street fights, including stories where Yokoyama won while outnumbered. He was suspended from <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> on various occasions for his misconduct outside of <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>.
              <br> <br> He wrote one of the first <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> training manuals in 1915 with Oshima Eisuke, titled Judo Kyohan. It covered judo in the old style, showcasing many pins, locks, chokes, and was notably originally written in English.
              <br> <br> Yokoyama hardly taught or trained in his forties, dying prematurely at 49 from esophageal cancer. He was posthumously awarded the first 8th <mark>dan</mark> in <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>.</p>

            <p>Mifune Kyūzō fell in love with judo in middle school, and it became his sole focus in life. He went to Tokyo under the pretense of further academic studies, but his true goal was to join <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He became a student of “Demon” Yokoyama Sakujirō in 1903.
              <br> <br> Although slight in stature, Mifune never allowed his size to inhibit his study of judo. In fact, he claimed that he was “grateful to [his] parents for giving [him] a small body. In order to overcome bigger opponents, [he had] to train twice as hard.” Due to his small size, Mifune worked tirelessly to perfect his technique, which is considered among the best in judo history. His technical expertise is demonstrated in his book, <mark>The Canon of Judo</mark> (<i>Judo no Shinzui</i>). Mifune also has no recorded losses in formal competitions.
              <br> <br> Mifune reached 6th <mark>dan</mark> in just ten years. 24 years later, Kanō Jigorō promoted him to 9th <mark>dan</mark> shortly before Kanō’s death. After Kanō’s death, he became the principal instructor at <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> and is credited for judo’s surge in growth in the postwar period. Mifune was finally promoted to 10th <mark>dan</mark> in 1945, 42 years after entering <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He never missed a single day of official training in his 62 years at <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>.

            <p>Yamashita Yoshitsugu was the son of a minor samurai and was interested in martial arts during his youth. In 1884, this interest led him to the <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> dojo where he learned judo under Kanō Jigorō. He already had martial arts experience prior to entering <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> and was well versed in the techniques of the <mark>Toshin ryū</mark> and the <mark>Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū</mark>.
              <br> <br> Yamashita was an exceptional judo practitioner, achieving 1st <mark>dan</mark> in just three months and 4th <mark>dan</mark> within two years. He would later achieve 6th <mark>dan</mark> in 1898, fourteen years after joining <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He is notable for becoming the first person to reach 10th <mark>dan</mark>, which was done posthumously in 1935. He had more success in <mark2>challenge matches</mark2> than Tomita Tsunejirō, but even so, he never impressed the United States military audiences enough for judo to be considered valuable in their military training. This was largely due to the time it takes to master judo.
              <br> <br> Yamashita is also well known as a judo instructor. Among those he taught was former president Theodore Roosevelt. After returning to Japan in 1906, he taught at multiple colleges and at the Police Bureau.</p>

Known mononymously by the name of the stadium its takes place in, the <mark>Kōshien</mark> tournament began as a high school baseball competition in 1915, which is now considered the beginning of competitive baseball in Japan. Founded by a rivalry between Osaka newspaper agencies Asahi shinbun and Mainichi shinbun, <mark>Kōshien</mark> had the greatest participation of any sporting event in the world before WWI with an average of 5,000 players. The popularity of the event spurred the need for a single-purpose baseball stadium in Japan. <mark>Kōshien</mark> stadium had been built and was the highest capacity baseball stadium in Japan until 1988. The <mark>Kōshien</mark> tournament featured players from all corners of Japan and all classes, diverging from elitist schools like <mark>Ichiko</mark>. Even today, the <mark>Kōshien</mark> tournament is widely regarded as the ultimate show of guts and courage for middle and high school baseball players, and it retains its popularity as an icon of Japanese baseball.

      <p ALIGN= "left"> The “Immortal Player,” Sawamura Eiji (1917–1944), was a Japanese professional baseball pitcher. Before the formation of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), Sawamura played an exhibition game against the All-American baseball team in 1934. Sawamura rose to fame during the match for consecutively striking out American legends including Babe Ruth (1895–1948) and Lou Gehrig (1903–1941). Despite an offer to play in the MLB, and the chance to be the first Japanese person to do so, Sawamura declined in favor of staying in Japan. Sawamura died during WWII when his ship was sunk by a torpedo. The annual Sawamura Eiji award, typically awarded to the greatest pitcher in Japanese baseball, was posthumously named in his honor.

      <h2>The Emperor’s Game</h2>
      <br>
      <p>On June 25, 1959, the Yomiuri Giants and Hanshin Tigers played the first baseball game a reigning emperor of Japan had ever attended. Then rookies, now famous <mark2>Ō Sadaharu</mark2> and <mark2>Nagashima Shigeo</mark2> played the first of many games they would both homer in. Rookie Tiger’s pitcher <mark2>Murayama Minoru</mark2>, who later that year won the <mark2>Sawamura Award</mark2>, joined the game in the eighth inning. Tied at the bottom of the ninth, Nagashima and Murayama had a showdown where Nagashima blasted the game-winning homerun out of the park mere minutes before <mark2>Emperor Hirohito</mark2> (1901–1989) left for the night. The game is remembered in Giants history as the game <mark2>Nagashima Shigeo</mark2> became a national baseball hero.

      <p> <br> <br> Ō Sadaharu (1940–) is a world-famous Chinese national baseball player born in Japan known for holding the world career home run record (868). He also held the record for most homeruns in a season in the NPB (55) until 2013. While Ō initially signed with the Yomiuri Giants as a pitcher, he couldn’t pitch at the professional level and instead worked on improving his batting. Working closely with coach Arakawa Hiroshi (1930-2016), Ō practiced his batting using techniques from Japanese martial arts. Ō would replicate batting by slicing through hanging sheets of paper with a katana, which is a kendo technique. He also learned from the founder of <mark>aikido</mark> how to tap into his <mark>ki</mark> and become a more disciplined baseball player. From these trainings, Ō  developed his iconic “flamingo” batting stance, where he raised his right leg up ninety degrees before swinging.

      <p> Blasted into fame after <mark2>The Emperor’s Game</mark2>, Nagashima Shigeo (1936–) is known around Japan as a national hero for his time as a player on the Yomiuri Giants. Nagashima and <mark2>Ō Sadaharu</mark2> batted back-to-back and were dubbed the "ON Cannon." Nagashima helped lead the Giants to dominate the central league championship through the 1960s and ‘70s. He won the <mark2>Best Nine Award</mark2> every year of his seventeen-year career. Nagashima periodically managed the Giants following his playing career. He was awarded the People’s Honour Award and the Order of Culture in 2013 and 2021 respectively for his contribution to Japanese baseball.

      <p> Alex Ramirez (1974–) was born in Venezuela and played his first Major League professional baseball game with the then Cleveland Indians in 1998. Having played with the Yakult Swallows, Yomiuri Giants, and the DeNa Baystars, he is the first foreigner to be inducted into the <mark>meikyukai</mark>, gaining the invitation with his 2,000th career hit with the NPB. He broke <mark2>Ō Sadaharu</mark2>’s record of consecutive seasons with over 100 RBIs. Foreign players in the NPB have had negative reputations for playing with bad attitudes and non-adherence to Japanese baseball culture, but Ramirez is widely regarded as an exception to this stereotype. Ramirez is now a naturalized Japanese citizen, and widely regarded as a one of the greatest foreigners to play for the NPB for how he embraced Japanese culture.

      <p> Nomo Hideo (1968–) was the first Japanese native baseball player to have a career in the MLB. Nomo’s professional career began in 1990 when he joined the Kintetsu Buffaloes. He won many awards including the Best Nine Award and the Sawamura Award. During his time with the Buffaloes, he also garnered the nickname “Tornado” due to his corkscrew pitching delivery. Despite his wishes to play in America, NPB players were not able to make the jump to the MLB until they spent ten years in the NPB. In order to join the MLB sooner, Nomo exploited a loophole by “retiring” from the NPB. This freed him to join the MLB, debuting with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1995. He is credited with opening the door for other Japanese players to play in the MLB under long term contracts.

Ichiro practiced baseball everyday with his father growing up, and practiced using unorthodox methods like swinging a coal shovel to simulate batting. Ichiro first signed with the Orix Blue Wave and played in the NPB until 2000, where he made the jump to the MLB to play for the Seattle Mariners. Ichiro was not only the first native Japanese <mark2>position player</mark2> signed to the MLB, but also the first Japanese MLB player inducted into the <mark>Meikyukai</mark>. Ichiro was known for his speed at the plate, utilizing a pendulum-like stance where he swung while leaning back on one leg, allowing him to begin running while finishing his swing.

      <p> Ōtani Shohei (1994–) is perhaps the most popular current MLB player, Japanese or otherwise. By age eighteen, he was already throwing 99 mph pitches. Ōtani wanted to go to the MLB directly after high school, but after being drafted by the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters in 2012, he decided to play in Japan before attempting to make the switch to the MLB. In 2017, Ōtani signed a deal with the Los Angeles Angels where he won the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year, but his 2019 and ‘20 seasons were hampered by injuries. It was in 2021 when Ōtani began to flourish. Since 2021, Ōtani has been popularly dubbed “Shotime” and has garnered unrivaled popularity in both the US and Japan. His success as a two-way player, both a batter and a pitcher, is rivaled only by the legendary Babe Ruth. In 2023, this newfound popularity paid off when Ōtani signed a $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the largest contract in professional sports history. Ōtani has been so highly awarded with both the NPB and MLB that it would take too long to list them all.
