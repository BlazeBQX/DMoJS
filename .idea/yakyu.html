Known mononymously by the name of the stadium its takes place in, the <mark>Kōshien</mark> tournament began as a high school baseball competition in 1915, which is now considered the beginning of competitive baseball in Japan. Founded by a rivalry between Osaka newspaper agencies Asahi shinbun and Mainichi shinbun, <mark>Kōshien</mark> had the greatest participation of any sporting event in the world before WWI with an average of 5,000 players. The popularity of the event spurred the need for a single-purpose baseball stadium in Japan. <mark>Kōshien</mark> stadium had been built and was the highest capacity baseball stadium in Japan until 1988. The <mark>Kōshien</mark> tournament featured players from all corners of Japan and all classes, diverging from elitist schools like <mark>Ichiko</mark>. Even today, the <mark>Kōshien</mark> tournament is widely regarded as the ultimate show of guts and courage for middle and high school baseball players, and it retains its popularity as an icon of Japanese baseball.

      <p ALIGN= "left"> The “Immortal Player,” Sawamura Eiji (1917–1944), was a Japanese professional baseball pitcher. Before the formation of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), Sawamura played an exhibition game against the All-American baseball team in 1934. Sawamura rose to fame during the match for consecutively striking out American legends including Babe Ruth (1895–1948) and Lou Gehrig (1903–1941). Despite an offer to play in the MLB, and the chance to be the first Japanese person to do so, Sawamura declined in favor of staying in Japan. Sawamura died during WWII when his ship was sunk by a torpedo. The annual Sawamura Eiji award, typically awarded to the greatest pitcher in Japanese baseball, was posthumously named in his honor.

      <h2>The Emperor’s Game</h2>
      <br>
      <p>On June 25, 1959, the Yomiuri Giants and Hanshin Tigers played the first baseball game a reigning emperor of Japan had ever attended. Then rookies, now famous <mark2>Ō Sadaharu</mark2> and <mark2>Nagashima Shigeo</mark2> played the first of many games they would both homer in. Rookie Tiger’s pitcher <mark2>Murayama Minoru</mark2>, who later that year won the <mark2>Sawamura Award</mark2>, joined the game in the eighth inning. Tied at the bottom of the ninth, Nagashima and Murayama had a showdown where Nagashima blasted the game-winning homerun out of the park mere minutes before <mark2>Emperor Hirohito</mark2> (1901–1989) left for the night. The game is remembered in Giants history as the game <mark2>Nagashima Shigeo</mark2> became a national baseball hero.

      <p> <br> <br> Ō Sadaharu (1940–) is a world-famous Chinese national baseball player born in Japan known for holding the world career home run record (868). He also held the record for most homeruns in a season in the NPB (55) until 2013. While Ō initially signed with the Yomiuri Giants as a pitcher, he couldn’t pitch at the professional level and instead worked on improving his batting. Working closely with coach Arakawa Hiroshi (1930-2016), Ō practiced his batting using techniques from Japanese martial arts. Ō would replicate batting by slicing through hanging sheets of paper with a katana, which is a kendo technique. He also learned from the founder of <mark>aikido</mark> how to tap into his <mark>ki</mark> and become a more disciplined baseball player. From these trainings, Ō  developed his iconic “flamingo” batting stance, where he raised his right leg up ninety degrees before swinging.

      <br>
      <p> Blasted into fame after <mark2>The Emperor’s Game</mark2>, Nagashima Shigeo (1936–) is known around Japan as a national hero for his time as a player on the Yomiuri Giants. Nagashima and <mark2>Ō Sadaharu</mark2> batted back-to-back and were dubbed the "ON Cannon." Nagashima helped lead the Giants to dominate the central league championship through the 1960s and ‘70s. He won the <mark2>Best Nine Award</mark2> every year of his seventeen-year career. Nagashima periodically managed the Giants following his playing career. He was awarded the People’s Honour Award and the Order of Culture in 2013 and 2021 respectively for his contribution to Japanese baseball.

      <p> Alex Ramirez (1974–) was born in Venezuela and played his first Major League professional baseball game with the then Cleveland Indians in 1998. Having played with the Yakult Swallows, Yomiuri Giants, and the DeNa Baystars, he is the first foreigner to be inducted into the <mark>meikyukai</mark>, gaining the invitation with his 2,000th career hit with the NPB. He broke <mark2>Ō Sadaharu</mark2>’s record of consecutive seasons with over 100 RBIs. Foreign players in the NPB have had negative reputations for playing with bad attitudes and non-adherence to Japanese baseball culture, but Ramirez is widely regarded as an exception to this stereotype. Ramirez is now a naturalized Japanese citizen, and widely regarded as a one of the greatest foreigners to play for the NPB for how he embraced Japanese culture.

      <img src="assets/images/yakyu5.jpg" ALIGN="right" VSPACE = "10" HSPACE= "10" style= "width:250px;height:200px"/>
      <p> Nomo Hideo (1968–) was the first Japanese native baseball player to have a career in the MLB. Nomo’s professional career began in 1990 when he joined the Kintetsu Buffaloes. He won many awards including the Best Nine Award and the Sawamura Award. During his time with the Buffaloes, he also garnered the nickname “Tornado” due to his corkscrew pitching delivery. Despite his wishes to play in America, NPB players were not able to make the jump to the MLB until they spent ten years in the NPB. In order to join the MLB sooner, Nomo exploited a loophole by “retiring” from the NPB. This freed him to join the MLB, debuting with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1995. He is credited with opening the door for other Japanese players to play in the MLB under long term contracts.

      <p>Suzuki Ichirō (1973–), known simply as “Ichiro” internationally, is the first native Japanese <mark2>position player</mark2> to play in the MLB. Ichiro practiced baseball everyday with his father growing up, and practiced using unorthodox methods like swinging a coal shovel to simulate batting. Ichiro first signed with the Orix Blue Wave and played in the NPB until 2000, where he made the jump to the MLB to play for the Seattle Mariners. Ichiro was not only the first native Japanese <mark2>position player</mark2> signed to the MLB, but also the first Japanese MLB player inducted into the <mark>Meikyukai</mark>. Ichiro was known for his speed at the plate, utilizing a pendulum-like stance where he swung while leaning back on one leg, allowing him to begin running while finishing his swing.

      <img src="assets/images/yakyu8.jpg" ALIGN="right" VSPACE = "10" HSPACE= "10" style= "width:200px;height:150px"/>
      <p> Ōtani Shohei (1994–) is perhaps the most popular current MLB player, Japanese or otherwise. By age eighteen, he was already throwing 99 mph pitches. Ōtani wanted to go to the MLB directly after high school, but after being drafted by the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters in 2012, he decided to play in Japan before attempting to make the switch to the MLB. In 2017, Ōtani signed a deal with the Los Angeles Angels where he won the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year, but his 2019 and ‘20 seasons were hampered by injuries. It was in 2021 when Ōtani began to flourish. Since 2021, Ōtani has been popularly dubbed “Shotime” and has garnered unrivaled popularity in both the US and Japan. His success as a two-way player, both a batter and a pitcher, is rivaled only by the legendary Babe Ruth. In 2023, this newfound popularity paid off when Ōtani signed a $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, the largest contract in professional sports history. Ōtani has been so highly awarded with both the NPB and MLB that it would take too long to list them all.
