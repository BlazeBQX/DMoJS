      <h2>Sumo’s mythical origins</h2>
      <br>
        <img src="assets/images/sumo1.jpg" ALIGN="right" VSPACE = "10" HSPACE= "10" style= "width:150px;height:200px"/>
      <p ALIGN= "left">Some, including the official Sumo Museum located in <i><mark>Ryōgoku</mark></i>, consider the legendary battle between two deities, Takemikazuchi and Takeminakata, to be the first sumo match. The legend, which can be found in the text <i><mark>Kōjiki</mark></i> (712), says that the thunder deity Takemikazuchi is sent to Honshu to conquer it for the Yamato. When he arrives, he is challenged by the resident deity Takeminakata to a feat of strength for his domain. Takemikazuchi easily defeats Takeminakata by crushing his hand, thus securing the Yamato region.
        <br> <br> The connection between this tale and sumo is dubious. The legend does not include the <i><mark>kanji</mark></i> for sumo (相撲), nor does it resemble sumo at any time. 
        <br> <br> The depiction here of Takemikazuchi is from another famous tale of his exploits. He is said to have subdued the giant catfish, known as namazu, that causes earthquakes.

      <h2>Nomi no Sukune defeats Taira no Kehaya</h2>

        <img src="assets/images/sumo2.jpg" ALIGN="right" VSPACE = "10" HSPACE= "10" style= "width:300px;height:200px"/>
      <p ALIGN= "left"> The apocryphal match between Nomi no Sukune and Taira no Kehaya is often considered the first sumo match between mortals. The story comes from <mark>Nihon shoki</mark> (720) and supposedly took place during the century-long reign of Emperor Suinin (69 BC–70, r. 29 BC–70).
        <br> <br> In the story, Taira no Kehaya is a terrible braggart who claims to be the strongest man in the realm. The emperor is displeased with the braggart’s conduct, but there are no worthy challengers until a skilled potter named Nomi no Sukune agrees to wrestle. Suinin watches as Sukune kills Kehaya by kicking him once in the ribs and once in the back. The elated emperor rewards Sukune for his victory by bequeathing the deceased man’s land to him.
        <br> <br> Like the story of Takemikazuchi, however, the kanji for sumo do not appear in this story, nor does the match resemble sumo at any time.
        <br> <br> One of the most famous courtiers of the Heian period (794–1185), Sugawara no Michizane (845–903), claimed direct descent from Nomi no Sukune.

      <p>The oldest usage of the kanji for sumo can be found in another story in Nihon shoki (720) that takes place during the reign of Emperor Yūryakū (418–479, r. 456–479). The story begins with a carpenter who states that he never makes mistakes. Yūryakū hears the carpenter’s boast and decides to put it to the test. He orders two girls working in the palace to undress and wrestle in front of the carpenter. The display causes the carpenter’s tool to slip, and Yūryakū demands that he be beheaded. In the end, Yūryakū spares the carpenter, and they exchange some poetic verses.
        <br> <br> Although the story is the first one to include the kanji for sumo, the salacious nature of the event, along with the gender of the participants, is why some historians wrongfully ignore this story. 
        <br> <br> Yūryakū, depicted here killing a boar, was a famed warrior and hunter known for his temper, his cruelty, and his love for poetry and women.

      <h2>The Annual Sumo Tournament</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="assets/images/sumo4.jpg" ALIGN="right" VSPACE = "10" HSPACE= "10" style= "width:250px;height:200px"/>
      <p> <br> <br> The annual sumo tournament was held in the courtyard of the southern hall (shishinden) of the imperial palace in Kyoto throughout the Heian period. The tournament was one of the largest events in the annual calendar, requiring months of coordination between courtiers in the capital and provincial governors. Despite the scale and logistical complexity required to organize such an event, the tournament was held in the seventh month nearly every year for centuries.  
        <br> <br> The tournament served multiple purposes, the most important of which was as a form of provincial capitulation to central authority. The wrestlers were strong men from the provinces who were recruited by the governor and then sent to the capital as annual tribute. At the tournament, they would wrestle one another in front of the emperor, his ladies-in-waiting, and many high-ranking courtiers.
        <br> <br> The tournament was also seen as one of the most entertaining events of the year. Many courtier diary entries and contemporary literary pieces describe the excitement surrounding the tournament. Superior wrestlers enjoyed better rewards for their victories and a unique celebrity status within the rigidly hierarchical court, with the best wrestlers being remembered centuries after their death. One such example was the dominant tenth-century wrestler, Ujinaga of Satsuma, who was used as a reference four centuries later to describe the strength of a warrior in Taiheiki.
        <br> <br> In the picture, you can see the wrestlers separated into a left and right group behind the curtains. Mid-ranking courtiers sit on elevated seats while high-ranking courtiers sit on the veranda. The emperor is behind the screen with his ladies-in-waiting. There is no boundary across which a wrestler could push his opponent to win. Instead, wrestlers had to force their opponent to touch the ground with anything other than the bottoms of their feet.

      <h2>The tournament for imperial succession in 858</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="assets/images/sumo5.jpg" ALIGN="right" VSPACE = "10" HSPACE= "10" style= "width:250px;height:200px"/>
      <p> According to multiple versions of The Tale of the Heike, which was written centuries later, the court could not decide between two capable successors to the throne following the death of Emperor Montoku (827–858, r. 850–858). The elder candidate, Prince Koretaka, was the first-born son and strove to be a benevolent ruler. The younger candidate, Korehito, was Montoku’s fourth son, but his maternal grandfather was the powerful courtier, Fujiwara no Yoshifusa (804–872). The political stalemate prompted those in power to let ten horse races and a sumo wrestling match determine the next emperor. The special competition drew an impressive audience with every courtier coming to watch the proceedings. The noble spectators split into two camps in support of one prince over the other. 
        <br> <br> The races were fittingly close, the riders representing Koretaka bested their opponents in the first four races before dropping the next six to Korehito’s riders. Thus, the fate of the next emperor came down to the sumo match. Koretaka’s representative was Natora, who had the strength of sixty ordinary men. Korehito’s champion was the smaller Yoshio.  When the two wrestlers clashed for the first time, Natora threw Yoshio some twenty feet, but the nimble Yoshio stuck his landing. The two grappled once again and it appeared that Yoshio would succumb to Natora’s strength. Fearing an imminent defeat, Korehito’s mother sent word about the dire situation to a monk who was praying for the younger candidate’s victory. Upon hearing the news, the monk took his vajra, bashed his head with it, and then offered his brain matter to turn the tide of the match. Miraculously, Yoshio defeated his larger opponent, and Korehito ascended the throne as Emperor Seiwa (850–880, r. 858–876).
        <br> <br> Seiwa is depicted here in Buddhist garb following his abdication of the throne.

      <h2>The annual sumo tournament of 1013</h2>

      <p>One of the most impactful annual sumo tournaments was at the center of a power struggle between Emperor Sanjō (976–1017, r. 1011–1016), pictured on the left, and the preeminent courtier, Fujiwara no Michinaga (966–1027), on the right. 
        <br> <br> The Fujiwara had held considerable power at court since Michinaga’s ancestor, Yoshifusa, became the first Fujiwara regent in 858. One of the ways in which the Fujiwara maintained a stranglehold on the regency was through marrying their daughters to emperors and raising their grandchildren to become future emperors. The Fujiwara would also often force older emperors to abdicate in favor of child emperors so the regents could hold even more power. 
        <br> <br> Emperor Sanjō was different from many other emperors of his time because he became emperor as an adult and had little connection to Michinaga or his line. Further, Sanjō wanted more direct control in matters of state. Both Sanjō and Michinaga tried to best the other through political machinations, a means by which the courtier was far superior to the emperor. To make matters worse for Sanjō, he was rapidly losing his eyesight and hearing. 
        <br> <br> By 1013, the emperor’s situation was dire, so he turned to divine will for reassurance. Prior to the annual sumo tournament, Sanjō prayed at Ise Grand Shrine for a sign. If the first three wrestlers representing the left team won the first three matches, then it was the will of the divine for Sanjō to continue his rule. If not, he would acquiesce to Michinaga and abdicate.
        <br> <br> He kept his divine wager a secret leading up to the tournament, but following his elation over the three wrestlers for the left having won their matches, he told some confidants of his gamble. For a brief period thereafter, Sanjō reasserted himself politically. Eventually he succumbed to his failing faculties, and he was forced to abdicate in 1016.

      <h2>Oda Nobunaga’s Sumo Tournament of 1578</h2>

      <p> Although the sources on sumo wrestlers during the Kamakura and Ashikaga shogunates pales in comparison to those of the Heian period, the few remaining sources show that wrestlers traveled the country to entertain powerful warrior leaders such as Minamoto no Yoritomo (1147–1199) and Ashikaga Yoshitane (1466–1523). Perhaps the most important of these demonstrations was a sumo tournament in 1578 that was organized by the dominant Sengoku daimyō Oda Nobunaga (1534–1582). Records state that some 300 wrestlers traveled to Nobunaga’s headquarters in Aizu for an opportunity to showcase their skills, with 23 men making the cut. The large turnout is evidence of Nobunaga’s power, wealth, and love of sumo.
        <br> <br> Nobunaga was by no means the only Sengoku daimyō who appreciated sumo. There are records of both Toyotomi Hideyoshi (1537–1598) and Tokugawa Ieyasu (1542–1616) staging sumo tournaments, among others. Daimyō patronage of sumo continued throughout the Edo period.

      <h2>The Yokozuna System</h2>
      <br>
      <img src="assets/images/sumo9.jpg" ALIGN="right" VSPACE = "10" HSPACE= "10" style= "width:300px;height:200px"/>
      <p>The history of the title for the top wrestler in sumo is complex. Fans of modern sumo will know that the title of yokozuna is given to only the best wrestlers, but that was not always the case. 
        <br> <br> During the Heian period, the strongest wrestler was called a hote. The title of hote was apt because the kanji translate to “best hand.” This term was no longer used, however, following the last annual sumo tournament in 1174.
        <br> <br> The term yokozuna derives from the horizontally-banded white rope that the wrestler wears. This white rope strongly resembles the white rope that is used for purification at Shinto shrines and other points of interest such as rocks and trees. Initially, the title of yokozuna was given to two wrestlers, one for the east and one for the west, to perform a unique ring-entering ceremony. While the first wrestlers chosen for this honor were usually great wrestlers, it was not until 1909 that the title became associated more with tournament success.
        <br> <br> To this day, the rules for promotion to yokozuna are far from concrete. Generally speaking, a wrestler may be promoted to yokozuna if he wins two consecutive tournaments at one of the highest ranks in the highest division. There are other factors, however, that play into the decision. The conduct of the wrestler, the number of current yokozuna, and the strength of competition are also considered.
        <br> <br> There is a large stele located at Tomioka Hachiman Shrine, pictured here, where every yokozuna has his name etched, including some mythical former wrestlers. Only yokozuna are remembered on this stone with one notable exception–Raiden Tameemon.

      <h2>The First Yokozuna</h2>

      <img src="assets/images/sumo10.jpg" ALIGN="right" VSPACE = "10" HSPACE= "10" style= "width:250px;height:150px"/>
      <p> Although Tanikaze Kajinosuke (1750–1795) and Onogawa Kisaburō (1758–1806) are officially considered the fourth and fifth yokozuna, they were the first men to be awarded the title in their lifetimes.
        <br> <br> Kajinosuke, depicted on the right, was a towering figure at over six feet tall and 375 pounds. He wrestled from 1769 to 1794, accruing an impressive record of 258 wins to 14 losses. Perhaps his most notable achievement was winning 63 consecutive matches from 1778 to 1782. Following his lone loss to Kisaburō in the spring tournament of 1782, he rattled off another 43 consecutive wins. Kajinosuke is also notable for being the teacher to the most dominant wrestler of the Edo period–Raiden Tameemon.
        <br> <br> Kisaburō, depicted on the left, had a more moderate build of 5’9’’ and 250 pounds. Despite his size, he had 144 wins to 13 losses from 1779 to 1798. His most notable achievement was breaking the hulking Kajinosuke’s consecutive win record in 1782.
