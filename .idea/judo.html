      <p ALIGN= "left"> Kanō Jigorō (1860–1938) created judo in 1882 and founded a dojo in the same year which would later be named <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He created judo by combining techniques from <mark>jujutsu</mark> schools that he was familiar with. He took the striking and strangling techniques from <mark>Tenjin Shin'yō</mark> and the throwing techniques from the <mark>Kito-ryū</mark> school.
        <br> <br> Kanō is also largely responsible for judo’s accessibility which led to its explosive international growth. Judo was designed to allow a smaller and weaker person to beat a larger, less-skilled person. Women were also accepted at <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> and spectators were invited to watch tournaments. Another important factor was Kanō’s revision of the ranking system. He created a system of ten ranks (<mark>dan</mark>) rather than the system of three that was standard in other forms of <mark>jujutsu</mark>. This change rewarded students more often, encouraging them to continue practicing judo. Kanō was a prominent educator who taught at various educational institutions, founded his own private institution, and also held various positions at the Ministry of Education. Due to this, Kanō was able to spread judo domestically through universities, the Naval Academy, and the Police Bureau. This domestic success encouraged Kanō to introduce judo abroad. Judo found quick success in Europe in the first half of the twentieth century, particularly in Britain, France, and Germany. Judo’s success both domestically and internationally led to its inclusion as an Olympic sport beginning with the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.

      <h2>Tomita Tsunejirō </h2>
      <br>
      <img src="assets/images/judo2.jpg" ALIGN="right" VSPACE = "10" HSPACE= "10" style= "width:150px;height:200px"/>
      <p ALIGN= "left"> Tomita Tsunejirō (1865–1937) was the first person to become a live-in student at <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He was only five years younger than Kanō Jigorō and was the student who Kanō spent the most time directly training. Tomita contributed greatly to the early development of <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> judo by testing <mark>jujutsu</mark> techniques with Kanō.
        <br> <br> Tomita was considered the least skilled and physically gifted of the <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> “<mark2>Kings</mark2>,” but even he had important victories that established <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> judo as a legitimate form of <mark>jujutsu</mark>. Namely, his victory over the giant Nakamura Hansuke (1845–1897), known as the “Demon Slayer of the <mark>Ryōi shintō-ryū</mark>.” He also had his fair share of notable defeats. His worst defeats were at a demonstration of judo to West Point cadets in 1905 and in front of President Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919) in 1908. Tomita returned to Japan in 1910, where he continued teaching judo as well as American physical education such as boxing and weight lifting. He taught these subjects until his death in 1937, after which he was promoted to 7th <mark>dan</mark>.
        <br> <br> Tomita’s son, Tsuneo, became a famous novelist and managed to reach 5th <mark>dan</mark>. His most famous work was Sugata Sanshirō, a novel about Saigō Shirō’s life. In 1943, a film adaptation of the book was the directorial debut of the famous Japanese director Kurosawa Akira. Since then, multiple films, TV series, and manga adaptations have been released, turning Saigō into a bigger legend than Kanō.

      <h2>Saigō Shirō</h2>

      <img src="assets/images/judo3.jpg" ALIGN="right" VSPACE = "10" HSPACE= "10" style= "width:150px;height:200px"/>
      <p>The details of Saigō Shirō’s (1866–1922) early life are cloudy. He lost his father when he was six, and it is rumored that he was a problem child who constantly got in street fights, a habit that continued into his adult life. Saigō wanted to enter the military academy and become a great general. So, in 1882, he left for Tokyo with his friend. Once he arrived in Tokyo, however, he soon realized it would be impossible to enter the military academy.
        <br> <br> After arriving in Tokyo, Saigō originally trained at the <mark>Tenjin Shin'yō</mark> dojo of Keitaro Inoue. Supposedly, Kanō Jigorō saw him training and was impressed with his talent, so he invited him to train at the <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> dojo. Saigō became the second live-in student at the dojo. Saigō had some martial arts training prior to entering <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>, but it is unclear who in Aizu-Wakamatsu taught him. Even Kanō Jigorō himself stated from the beginning that Saigō was hard to handle. Saigō reached 5th <mark>dan</mark> at age 21, skipping 4th <mark>dan</mark> in the process. He is said to have been so skilled that after seeing a technique only once he could not only remember it, but improve upon it.
        <br> <br> Ultimately, Saigō departed from <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> sometime after 1886. <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> claimed that he was expelled, but he claims that he left voluntarily to join the <mark>tairiku ronin</mark>.

      <h2>Yokoyama “Demon” Sakujirō </h2>

      <img src="assets/images/judo4.jpg" ALIGN="right" VSPACE = "10" HSPACE= "10" style= "width:150px;height:200px"/>
      <p> Yokoyama Sakujirō (1864–1912) is famous for being the most physically powerful of the <mark2>Four Kings</mark2> of <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He is rumored to have sliced a burglar in half with a sword at only thirteen years old. 
        <br> <br> Yokoyama trained at the <mark>Tenjin Shin'yō ryū</mark>, but switched to <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> in 1886 after losing to the much smaller Saigō Shirō in a challenge match. Yokoyama and Saigō had vastly different styles; Yokoyama was described as a wild boar while Saigō was likened to an expertly trained thoroughbred. Prior to entering <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>, he was already skilled in the techniques of <mark>Tenjin Shin'yō ryū</mark> <mark>jujutsu</mark>, so he was able to reach 2nd <mark>dan</mark> in just six months at <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. Due to his fighting style and incredible raw strength he earned the nickname “Demon.” His nickname is unrelated to “Demon-Slayer” Nakamura Hansuke, but the two did compete in a match that lasted 55 minutes, ending in a tie. Yokoyama, like Saigō, got in many street fights, including stories where Yokoyama won while outnumbered. He was suspended from <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> on various occasions for his misconduct outside of <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>.
        <br> <br> He wrote one of the first <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> training manuals in 1915 with Oshima Eisuke, titled Judo Kyohan. It covered judo in the old style, showcasing many pins, locks, chokes, and was notably originally written in English.
        <br> <br> Yokoyama hardly taught or trained in his forties, dying prematurely at 49 from esophageal cancer. He was posthumously awarded the first 8th <mark>dan</mark> in <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>.

      <h2>Yamashita Yoshitsugu aka Yoshiaki</h2>

      <img src="assets/images/judo5.jpg" ALIGN="right" VSPACE = "10" HSPACE= "10" style= "width:150px;height:200px"/>
      <p> Yamashita Yoshitsugu (1865–1935) was the son of a minor samurai and was interested in martial arts during his youth. In 1884, this interest led him to the <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> dojo where he learned judo under Kanō Jigorō. He already had martial arts experience prior to entering <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> and was well versed in the techniques of the <mark>Toshin ryū</mark> and the <mark>Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū</mark>.
        <br> <br> Yamashita was an exceptional judo practitioner, achieving 1st <mark>dan</mark> in just three months and 4th <mark>dan</mark> within two years. He would later achieve 6th <mark>dan</mark> in 1898, fourteen years after joining <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He is notable for becoming the first person to reach 10th <mark>dan</mark>, which was done posthumously in 1935. He had more success in <mark2>challenge matches</mark2> than Tomita Tsunejirō, but even so, he never impressed the United States military audiences enough for judo to be considered valuable in their military training. This was largely due to the time it takes to master judo.
        <br> <br> Yamashita is also well known as a judo instructor. Among those he taught was former president Theodore Roosevelt. After returning to Japan in 1906, he taught at multiple colleges and at the Police Bureau.

      <img src="assets/images/judo6.jpg" ALIGN="right" VSPACE = "10" HSPACE= "10" style= "width:150px;height:200px"/>
      <p>Mifune Kyūzō (1883–1965) fell in love with judo in middle school, and it became his sole focus in life. He went to Tokyo under the pretense of further academic studies, but his true goal was to join <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He became a student of “Demon” Yokoyama Sakujirō in 1903.
        <br> <br> Although slight in stature, Mifune never allowed his size to inhibit his study of judo. In fact, he claimed that he was “grateful to [his] parents for giving [him] a small body. In order to overcome bigger opponents, [he had] to train twice as hard.” Due to his small size, Mifune worked tirelessly to perfect his technique, which is considered among the best in judo history. His technical expertise is demonstrated in his book, <mark>The Canon of Judo</mark> (<i>Judo no Shinzui</i>). Mifune also has no recorded losses in formal competitions.
        <br> <br> Mifune reached 6th <mark>dan</mark> in just ten years. 24 years later, Kanō Jigorō promoted him to 9th <mark>dan</mark> shortly before Kanō’s death. After Kanō’s death, he became the principal instructor at <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> and is credited for judo’s surge in growth in the postwar period. Mifune was finally promoted to 10th <mark>dan</mark> in 1945, 42 years after entering <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He never missed a single day of official training in his 62 years at <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He died of throat cancer in 1965 at the age of 81.

      <img src="assets/images/judo7.jpg" ALIGN="right" VSPACE = "10" HSPACE= "10" style= "width:150px;height:200px"/>
      <p> Matsutarō Shōriki (1885–1969) started practicing judo in middle school, reaching 3rd <mark>dan</mark> before graduating from Japan’s preeminent university, Tokyo University, in 1911. 
        <br> <br> By 1926, Matsutarō had reached 5th <mark>dan</mark>, but after 1926 he had very little time to train. He shifted his attention to media and launched multiple business ventures. He founded the newspaper agency <i>Yomiuri shinbun</i>, the Japanese Professional Baseball League and the league’s first team the Yomiuri Giants, and Japan’s first commercial television station (Nippon Television Network).  His life was not without controversy, however. Matsutarō was accused by the Korean government of inciting the massacre of <mark>zainichi</mark> after the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake. He was also classified as a class A war criminal, after World War II, and was imprisoned for two years. He is also notable for his success as a politician, serving as the first chairman of Japan’s Atomic Energy Commission, and more recently it was discovered that he worked as a CIA agent. 
        <br> <br> In terms of judo, however, Matsutarō is noted for being the first “nonprofessional” to be awarded 10th <mark>dan</mark>. He was awarded 10th <mark>dan</mark> as a result of his massive financial contributions to the promotion of <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> as well as the construction of the new <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> headquarters in 1958.

      <p> Fukuda Keiko (1913–2013) was the longest surviving student of Kanō Jigorō until her death in 2013. 
        <br> <br> She achieved 5th <mark>dan</mark> in 1953, which was the limit for women at the time. Following a successful campaign to abolish the limit in 1972, Fukuda Keiko and Noritomi Masako (1913–1982) were awarded 6th <mark>dan</mark>. In 1994, Fukuda was the first woman to receive the ranking of 8th <mark>dan</mark>. After being promoted to 9th <mark>dan</mark> by the United States Judo Federation (USJF) in 2001, another petition was started to grant her the same rank from <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. Fukuda waited five years for the petition to be accepted. In 2011, Fukuda received promotion to 10th <mark>dan</mark> from the USJF, becoming the first women to achieve a rank of 10th <mark>dan</mark>. 
        <br> <br> She was a heavy advocate of <mark>kata</mark>. She was particularly fond of <mark>ju-no-kata</mark>, which is a stretching exercise that requires no mat or particular uniform and it does not involve throwing so it can be practiced by anyone. She wrote a book on <mark>ju-no-kata</mark> in 2004 titled <mark>Ju-No-Kata: A Kodokan textbook, revised and expanded from Born for the Mat</mark>. 
        <br> <br> Some of her other notable achievements include the creation of the Soko Joshi Judo Club, a women’s judo club in San Francisco that holds classes and kata tournaments. She also established the annual Joshi Judo Camp, a training camp for women from around the world. She was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the Japanese government, which recognizes long-term public service. Fukuda’s legacy lives on in the annual Fukuda Invitational Kata Championships and the Keiko Fukuda Judo Scholarship.
