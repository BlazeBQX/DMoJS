          <div class="text" style="width:100%;margin-left: 30px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
              <li>Judo is the only native Japanese sport that is consistently included in the Olympics. It has appeared in every Olympics since 1964, excluding 1968.</li>
              <li>The only form of equipment used in judo is a judogi, which is a heavy cotton uniform with a jacket and trousers.
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 30px;">
                  <li>In a match one competitor wears white and the other wears blue. The competitor on the top line of the bracket always wears white.</li>
                  <li>Women are also allowed to wear a white shirt underneath the jacket, but men are not.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
                
              
              <li>Matches are separated into seven weight classes for both the men and women’s events. There is a different system in the recently added mixed-team events. In the mixed-team events, three men and three women compete in individual matches and score points for their team rather than themselves.
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 30px;margin-bottom: 20px;">
                <li>men’s weight classes: -60kg, -66kg, -73kg, -81kg, -90kg, -100kg, +100kg</li>
                <li>women’s weight classes: -48kg, -52kg, -57kg, -63kg, -70kg, -78kg, +78kg</li>
                <li>mixed-team weight classes: -57kg women, -70kg women, +70kg women, -73kg men, -90kg men, +90kg men</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Men’s matches are five minutes long, and women’s matches are four minutes long. If the match is tied at the end of regulation, there is a sudden-death overtime where the first point, known as the “golden point,” wins.</li>
              <li>There are two types of penalties in judo: <mark>hansoku-make</mark>, and <mark>shido</mark>.
                <ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 30px;margin-bottom: 20px;">
                  <li><mark>Hansoku-make</mark> are serious infringements such as intentionally trying to injure an opponent. These penalties result in immediate disqualification.</li>
                  <li><mark>Shido</mark> are minor infringements such as intentionally stepping out of bounds or being too passive. If a competitor receives four in a match, they are disqualified.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>

            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
              <li>There are three ways to score in judo: ippon, waza-ari, and yuko. An ippon is worth 100 points, a waza-ari is worth 10 and a yuko is worth 1.</li>
              <li>Scoring an ippon immediately ends the match. There are four ways to score an ippon:
                <ol style="margin-left: 30px;margin-bottom: 20px;padding:20px">
                  <li>Performing a “perfect throw” by throwing your opponent onto their back with force, speed, and control.</li>
                  <li>Immobilizing an opponent for 20 seconds with a grappling technique while your opponent does not control a part of your body.</li>
                  <li>Choking your opponent until they tap out or pass out.</li>
                  <li>Locking your opponent's arm until they give up or their elbow is dislocated.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>Another way to win before the end of regulation is by scoring two waza-ari. A waza-ari is earned by completing a throw that is not quite an ippon because it lacks one of the three elements explained above. Waza-ari are also earned by immobilizing an opponent for 15–20 seconds.</li>
              <li>Yuko can be scored in a similar fashion, but they are throws that lack two elements of an ippon, or holds that are between 10–15 seconds.</li>
              <li>Two waza-ari equal one ippon, but no amount of yuko can equal a waza-ari.</li>
            </ul>
