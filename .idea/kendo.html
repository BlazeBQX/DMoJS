            <p>The Kōbusho was a school established in 1856 by the Tokugawa shogunate to prepare for war against foreign nations. Within this school, various forms of military strategies were taught such as gunnery, the use of spears, and rowing. From this point on, competitive styles of practicing kendo were given official approval. Swordsmanship was taught by a total of eleven instructors and the shinai length was also standardized to three feet and nine inches. The school was closed ten years later in 1866.

            <p>Tsukahara Bokuden (1489–1571) was the greatest master of the Shinto-ryū school of kendo. This school focused on teaching students how to attack the opponent’s vulnerable areas such as the neck, armpit, and thigh. Bokuden fought in eighteen duels and 36 battles in which he killed 212 people. Bokuden’s philosophy of martial arts was that it is used to sense danger and avoid it before it strikes. </p>
            <br>
            <p>At 27 years old, Bokuden stayed at Kashima shrine for a thousand days to reach enlightenment. During this period, Bokuden did not speak to anyone and had a strict diet of grains. Bokuden was also a close acquaintance of Takeda Shingen whom he followed to the Battle of Kawanakajima.

            <p>Hidetsuna Kamiizumi (1508–1577) was a <mark2>Muromachi</mark2>-period swordsman who started his career in Kōzuke province where he serviced the head of Minowa Castle. In 1566, the castle was attacked by the Takeda clan. Kamiizumi, leading the defenses, charged out of the castle and into the enemy forces. This counter was only successful for a short time before the castle eventually fell to the Takeda.
              <br> <br> Kamiizumi’s swordsmanship revolved around “the life-giving sword” (<i>katsujin-ken</i>) and Hidetsuna himself shunned the idea of the “killing sword” (<i>setsunin-tō</i>). These two concepts did not refer to the sword itself, but how the wielder used it. Although he was known to be unrivaled in martial skill, he disliked the idea of killing his challengers and would lean towards pacifism if it was possible. Kamiizumi was most notable for his invention of the bagged bamboo swords (<i>fukuro-shinai</i>). He also established the <mark>Shinkage-ryū</mark> school.</p>

            <p>Swords and the art of swordsmanship have been a staple to Japanese culture since the beginning of its history. In Kōjiki (712), there are stories of mythological gods that saw swords as symbols of life and peace. There is one story about the sun goddess Amaterasu who broke a sword into three pieces, from which three gods were born. In another story, her brother, Susanoo, killed an eight-headed giant snake, leading him to find a sword inside one of its tails. This sword, Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi, became one of the three Imperial Regalia of Japan.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>From the Sengoku period to the Edo period, many schools of swordsmanship were founded by prominent masters such as Iizasa Chōsai, Chiba Shūsaku, and Itō Ittōsai. Many of these schools were inherited by devoted students of these masters who further developed their techniques.

            <p>Itō Ittōsai (1560–1653), a descendant of the <mark2>Kamakura</mark2> family, was a swordsman from Izu Ōshima. When he was fourteen years old, Ittōsai fought and won against a kendo master named Tomita Ippō. After this victory, he was awarded a sword forged by swordsmith Ichimonji of Bizen province. During his stay at a priest’s house, Ittōsai was ambushed by Tomita’s students. Ittōsai defeated all of the attackers, killing the last enemy by slicing through both the attacker and the pot he was hiding behind. Therefore, his sword was named “Ichimonji’s pot-splitting sword” (<i>Kamewari Ichimonji</i>). Ittōsai practiced <mark>musha shugyō</mark>, training under different masters from various parts of Japan. He went around the country with a banner reading, “The best in Japan, Supreme expert of kenjutsu, Itō Ittōsai” which he used as a way to attract good teachers.
              <br> <br> Ittōsai is known for his establishment of the <mark>Ittō-ryū</mark> school. Ittōsai is also known for winning 33 duels in his life. Unlike other prominent swordsmen such as Yagyū Munenori and Miyamoto Musashi, Ittōsai never sought religious enlightenment, prestige, or employment. Instead, he strictly strove to improve his swordsmanship.</p>

            <p>Miyamoto Musashi (1584–1645) was the most famous swordsman of the seventeenth century who systemized the use of two swords. He wrote <i>The Book of Five Rings</i> (<i>Gorin no Shō</i>) in which he explores the technical side of swordsmanship as well as the philosophy behind the man holding the sword. The Five Rings are categorized into chapters: Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Sky. Musashi criticized the <mark>fukuro-shinai</mark> invented by <mark2>Kamiizumi</mark2>, declaring that they were only for cowards. Musashi is thus known for using the stronger and heavier wooden swords (<i>bokken</i>). 
              <br> <br> Musashi had his first duel at thirteen when a samurai posted a sign stating that he would challenge anyone in a duel. Musashi wrote that he would accept the samurai’s challenge and successfully crushed his skull with a wooden sword after throwing him to the ground. Miyamoto would go on to win sixty duels by the time he was 28. Another popular duel between Musashi and <mark2>Sasaki Kojirō</mark2> took place in 1612. Musashi arrived to the duel three hours late and brought a wooden sword that he carved out of an oar. The duel ended when Musashi barely dodged an attack from Kojirō and struck him on the head with his sword. A week before his death in 1645, Muashi wrote <i>The Way of Walking Alone</i> (<i>Dōkkodō</i>). This work consists of 21 precepts on self discipline.</p>

            <p>Fukuda Keiko was the longest surviving student of Kanō Jigorō until her death in 2013. 
              <br> <br> She achieved 5th <mark>dan</mark> in 1953, which was the limit for women at the time. Following a successful campaign to abolish the limit in 1972, Fukuda Keiko and Noritomi Masako (1913–1982) were awarded 6th <mark>dan</mark>. In 1994, Fukuda was the first woman to receive the ranking of 8th <mark>dan</mark>. After being promoted to 9th <mark>dan</mark> by the United States Judo Federation (USJF) in 2001, another petition was started to grant her the same rank from <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. Fukuda waited five years for the petition to be accepted. In 2011, Fukuda received promotion to 10th <mark>dan</mark> from the USJF, becoming the first women to achieve a rank of 10th <mark>dan</mark>. 
              <br> <br> She was a heavy advocate of <mark>kata</mark>. She was particularly fond of <mark>ju-no-kata</mark>, which is a stretching exercise that requires no mat or particular uniform and it does not involve throwing so it can be practiced by anyone. She wrote a book on <mark>ju-no-kata</mark> in 2004 titled <mark>Ju-No-Kata: A Kodokan textbook, revised and expanded from Born for the Mat</mark>. 
              <br> <br> Some of her other notable achievements include the creation of the Soko Joshi Judo Club, a women’s judo club in San Francisco that holds classes and kata tournaments. She also established the annual Joshi Judo Camp, a training camp for women from around the world. She was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure by the Japanese government, which recognizes long-term public service. Fukuda’s legacy lives on in the annual Fukuda Invitational Kata Championships and the Keiko Fukuda Judo Scholarship.</p>

            <p>Yokoyama Sakujirō is famous for being the most physically powerful of the <mark2>Four Kings</mark2> of <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He is rumored to have sliced a burglar in half with a sword at only thirteen years old. 
              <br> <br> Yokoyama trained at the <mark>Tenjin Shin'yō ryū</mark>, but switched to <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> in 1886 after losing to the much smaller Saigō Shirō in a challenge match. Yokoyama and Saigō had vastly different styles; Yokoyama was described as a wild boar while Saigō was likened to an expertly trained thoroughbred. Prior to entering <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>, he was already skilled in the techniques of <mark>Tenjin Shin'yō ryū</mark> <mark>jujutsu</mark>, so he was able to reach 2nd <mark>dan</mark> in just six months at <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. Due to his fighting style and incredible raw strength he earned the nickname “Demon.” His nickname is unrelated to “Demon-Slayer” Nakamura Hansuke, but the two did compete in a match that lasted 55 minutes, ending in a tie. Yokoyama, like Saigō, got in many street fights, including stories where Yokoyama won while outnumbered. He was suspended from <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> on various occasions for his misconduct outside of <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>.
              <br> <br> He wrote one of the first <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> training manuals in 1915 with Oshima Eisuke, titled Judo Kyohan. It covered judo in the old style, showcasing many pins, locks, chokes, and was notably originally written in English.
              <br> <br> Yokoyama hardly taught or trained in his forties, dying prematurely at 49 from esophageal cancer. He was posthumously awarded the first 8th <mark>dan</mark> in <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>.</p>

            <p>Mifune Kyūzō fell in love with judo in middle school, and it became his sole focus in life. He went to Tokyo under the pretense of further academic studies, but his true goal was to join <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He became a student of “Demon” Yokoyama Sakujirō in 1903.
              <br> <br> Although slight in stature, Mifune never allowed his size to inhibit his study of judo. In fact, he claimed that he was “grateful to [his] parents for giving [him] a small body. In order to overcome bigger opponents, [he had] to train twice as hard.” Due to his small size, Mifune worked tirelessly to perfect his technique, which is considered among the best in judo history. His technical expertise is demonstrated in his book, <mark>The Canon of Judo</mark> (<i>Judo no Shinzui</i>). Mifune also has no recorded losses in formal competitions.
              <br> <br> Mifune reached 6th <mark>dan</mark> in just ten years. 24 years later, Kanō Jigorō promoted him to 9th <mark>dan</mark> shortly before Kanō’s death. After Kanō’s death, he became the principal instructor at <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> and is credited for judo’s surge in growth in the postwar period. Mifune was finally promoted to 10th <mark>dan</mark> in 1945, 42 years after entering <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He never missed a single day of official training in his 62 years at <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>.

            <p>Yamashita Yoshitsugu was the son of a minor samurai and was interested in martial arts during his youth. In 1884, this interest led him to the <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> dojo where he learned judo under Kanō Jigorō. He already had martial arts experience prior to entering <mark>Kōdōkan</mark> and was well versed in the techniques of the <mark>Toshin ryū</mark> and the <mark>Tenjin Shin'yō-ryū</mark>.
              <br> <br> Yamashita was an exceptional judo practitioner, achieving 1st <mark>dan</mark> in just three months and 4th <mark>dan</mark> within two years. He would later achieve 6th <mark>dan</mark> in 1898, fourteen years after joining <mark>Kōdōkan</mark>. He is notable for becoming the first person to reach 10th <mark>dan</mark>, which was done posthumously in 1935. He had more success in <mark2>challenge matches</mark2> than Tomita Tsunejirō, but even so, he never impressed the United States military audiences enough for judo to be considered valuable in their military training. This was largely due to the time it takes to master judo.
              <br> <br> Yamashita is also well known as a judo instructor. Among those he taught was former president Theodore Roosevelt. After returning to Japan in 1906, he taught at multiple colleges and at the Police Bureau.</p>

      <p ALIGN= "left"> Hidetsuna Kamiizumi (1508–1577) was a <mark2>Muromachi</mark2>-period swordsman who started his career in Kōzuke province where he serviced the head of Minowa Castle. In 1566, the castle was attacked by the Takeda clan. Kamiizumi, leading the defenses, charged out of the castle and into the enemy forces. This counter was only successful for a short time before the castle eventually fell to the Takeda.
        <br> <br> Kamiizumi’s swordsmanship revolved around “the life-giving sword” (<i>katsujin-ken</i>) and Hidetsuna himself shunned the idea of the “killing sword” (<i>setsunin-tō</i>). These two concepts did not refer to the sword itself, but how the wielder used it. Although he was known to be unrivaled in martial skill, he disliked the idea of killing his challengers and would lean towards pacifism if it was possible. Kamiizumi was most notable for his invention of the bagged bamboo swords (<i>fukuro-shinai</i>). He also established the <mark>Shinkage-ryū</mark> school.

      <p>Itō Ittōsai (1560–1653), a descendant of the <mark2>Kamakura</mark2> family, was a swordsman from Izu Ōshima. When he was fourteen years old, Ittōsai fought and won against a kendo master named Tomita Ippō. After this victory, he was awarded a sword forged by swordsmith Ichimonji of Bizen province. During his stay at a priest’s house, Ittōsai was ambushed by Tomita’s students. Ittōsai defeated all of the attackers, killing the last enemy by slicing through both the attacker and the pot he was hiding behind. Therefore, his sword was named “Ichimonji’s pot-splitting sword” (<i>Kamewari Ichimonji</i>). Ittōsai practiced <mark>musha shugyō</mark>, training under different masters from various parts of Japan. He went around the country with a banner reading, “The best in Japan, Supreme expert of kenjutsu, Itō Ittōsai” which he used as a way to attract good teachers.
        <br> <br> Ittōsai is known for his establishment of the <mark>Ittō-ryū</mark> school. Ittōsai is also known for winning 33 duels in his life. Unlike other prominent swordsmen such as Yagyū Munenori and Miyamoto Musashi, Ittōsai never sought religious enlightenment, prestige, or employment. Instead, he strictly strove to improve his swordsmanship.

      <p> <br> <br> Miyamoto Musashi (1584–1645) was the most famous swordsman of the seventeenth century who systemized the use of two swords. He wrote <i>The Book of Five Rings</i> (<i>Gorin no Shō</i>) in which he explores the technical side of swordsmanship as well as the philosophy behind the man holding the sword. The Five Rings are categorized into chapters: Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, and Sky. Musashi criticized the <mark>fukuro-shinai</mark> invented by <mark2>Kamiizumi</mark2>, declaring that they were only for cowards. Musashi is thus known for using the stronger and heavier wooden swords (<i>bokken</i>). 
        <br> <br> Musashi had his first duel at thirteen when a samurai posted a sign stating that he would challenge anyone in a duel. Musashi wrote that he would accept the samurai’s challenge and successfully crushed his skull with a wooden sword after throwing him to the ground. Miyamoto would go on to win sixty duels by the time he was 28. Another popular duel between Musashi and <mark2>Sasaki Kojirō</mark2> took place in 1612. Musashi arrived to the duel three hours late and brought a wooden sword that he carved out of an oar. The duel ended when Musashi barely dodged an attack from Kojirō and struck him on the head with his sword. A week before his death in 1645, Muashi wrote <i>The Way of Walking Alone</i> (<i>Dōkkodō</i>). This work consists of 21 precepts on self discipline.

      <p> Yagyū Munenori (1571–1646) is well known for his publication of <i>A Hereditary Book on the Art of War</i> (<i>Heihō kadensho</i>) in 1632. This text explores the religious and philosophical aspects of swordsmanship. For example, Munenori describes how one ought to keep their mind calm when the body is on the offensive. In one chapter, he claims that weapons of war are destructive and killing goes against the “way of heaven” (<i>tendō</i>). Munenori was also a student of a Zen priest known as Sōhō Takuan who influenced his writings. According to Munenori, the purpose of kendo training is to remove “sickness” in the mind. The ultimate goal is a neutral state of mind (<i>byōjōshin</i>). Munenori was also a teacher of the second and third Tokugawa shoguns.

      <p>Chiba Shūsaku (1794–1856) developed the <i>Genbukan</i>, a school established in 1822 in Tokyo. This school became very successful due to Shūsaku’s ability to simplify the eight ranks of <mark>Ittō-ryū</mark> school into three. This led to a reduced fee that students were required to pay that also fueled the popularity of <i>Genbukan</i>. Shūsaku’s emphasis on training both the body and the mind heavily influenced the modernization of kendo during the <mark2>Meiji period</mark2>. According to Shūsaku, speed is victory. 
        <br> <br> He also wrote the <i>Secret Methods of the Sword</i> (<i>Kenpō Hiketsu</i>). In this book, Shūsaku concludes that there are 68 techniques in kendo. Shūsaku also shows his superb ability to teach kendo in the <i>Ten Merits in Striking</i> (<i>kenjutsu uchikomi jūtoku</i>). In this list, Shūsaku highlights points that allow beginners to learn quickly, such as “swing the arms freely” and “move the whole body lightly and freely.” His different teaching methods, such as teaching <mark>uchikomi-keiko</mark> before <mark>kata</mark>, made his dojo become one of the three biggest in Edo.

Tesshū is known to have systemized the <mark>Mutō-ryū</mark> (no-sword school). In his dojo, beginner students were viciously attacked without instructions. These students were to learn how to defend themselves by being hit in the body multiple times. Students who challenged themselves in this dojo were forced to train from morning to late afternoon. Those strong enough to survive these challenges found blood in their urine and feces. Some also could not differentiate dreams from reality due to severe exhaustion. Tesshū himself is known to have done 200 matches a day for a whole week during training.

      <p>Sakakibara Kenkichi was a swordsman of the nineteenth century. He earned his certification in his twenties after being trained under <mark2>Odani Seiichirō</mark2> who was of the <mark>Jikishinkage-ryū</mark> school. Kenkichi grew up during the prohibition on wearing swords (1876) and the decline of the samurai class. As a poor swordsman who was loyal to the shogunate, he devoted his time to reviving the culture of swordsmanship while rejecting the new society brought by the <mark2>Meiji Restoration</mark2> (1868). 
        Kenkichi’s contribution to kendo began when he established the <i>Gekken kaisha</i> in 1872. This company conducted public demonstrations of martial arts that allowed poor swordsmen to earn money. The success of these public demonstrations attracted other swordsmen who copied Kenkichi and built their own businesses. By September of that year, Tokyo had twenty companies that displayed a variety of martial arts.
